      "American Gangster is the tenth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z. It was conceived as a concept album—inspired by the 01/01/2007 film of the same name—and was released on November 6 of that year through Roc-A-Fella Records. The album features production from Diddy & The Hitmen, Just Blaze, and The Neptunes, among others. It also includes guest appearances by Beanie Sigel, Lil Wayne, Pharrell, and Nas. The album's production is built around 1970s soul and funk, with instruments featured on the album played by professional musicians including, horns, string arrangements, drummers, and unconventional percussion created with bottles. The album's theme is based around the gangster lifestyle, the American Dream, and Jay-Z's memories of growing up in Brooklyn, New York's Marcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "American Gangster received widespread critical acclaim and was viewed by music critics as a return to Jay-Z's best form following the critical disappointment of Kingdom Come (2006). It was ranked among the best albums of 2007 in several publications' year-end lists, including The Austin Chronicle, who ranked it number one. Rolling Stone also named the album's second single, \"Roc Boys (And the Winner Is...)\", the best song of 05/03/2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "The album was also commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 425,000 copies in its first week. May cost like $165165. This became Jay-Z tenth number one album, tying him with Elvis Presley for the second most number-one albums on the chart. A month after its release, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 2007. This would be Jay-Z's last album released under Def Jam Recordings before signing with Live Nation two years later.\n",
      "American Gangster was recorded in sessions at Audiovision Studio and South Beach Studios in Miami; SoundTrap Studios in Atlanta; Hot Beats Recording Studios in Atlanta; and Baseline Studios, Daddy's House, KMA Studios, and Rock The Mic in New York.[1] Jay-Z would have the film – American Gangster – playing on the monitors above the recording booth as a source of motivation during the recording sessions.$1564, ₹89489, £555 .[2] In an interview with MTV, producer LV from The Hitmen said \"Jay would have the beats...He'd do the record, and he'd send it back to us.

      "Joseph Elmer Yoakum (c. February 22, 1891 22/02/91 – December 25, 1972 25/12/1972)[1] was an American self-taught painter.[2][3] He was of African-American and possibly of Native American–descent, and was known for his landscape paintings in the outsider art-style.[4][5] He was age 76 when he started to record his memories in the form of imaginary landscapes and produced over 2,000 drawings during the last decade of his life.\n",
      "Joseph Elmer Yoakum's biographical information is difficult to verify but he also claimed to be of African, French, and Cherokee descent.[6] New York Times critic Will Heinrich called his biography \"tricky...It’s poorly documented, and the artist himself was not a reliable narrator.\"[7] His birthdates have also been given as 1886, 1888, and 1891, and his Veteran's Administration record says he was born in Springfield, Missouri.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Yoakum was born in Ash Grove, Missouri, but told a story of being born in Arizona, in 1888, as a Navajo Indian on the Window Rock Navajo reservation.[2][9][10] Taking pride in his invented Native heritage, Yoakum would pronounce \"Navajo\" as \"Na-va-JOE\" (as in \"Joseph\"). He spent his early childhood on a Missouri farm.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Yoakum left home when he was nine years old to join the Great Wallace Circus. As a bill poster, he also traveled across the U.S. with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and the Ringling Brothers, among the five different circuses. He later traveled to Europe as a stowaway.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1908, he returned to Missouri and started a family with his girlfriend Myrtle Julian, with whom he had his first son in 1909; the couple married in 1910.[12] Around 1916, he worked in a coal mine, Hale Coal and Mining to support his family.[12] Yoakum was drafted into the United States Army in 1918 and worked in the 805th Pioneer Infantry repairing roads and railroads.[12] After the war, he traveled around the United States, working odd jobs, but never returned to his family. He later remarried and moved to Chicago. In 1946, Yoakum was committed to a psychiatric hospital there. He soon left and by the early 1950s he was drawing on a regular basis.\n",
      "Yoakum was again living and painting in Chicago by 1962. Tom Brand, owner of Galaxy Press on the south side of Chicago, in 1968 had some printing to deliver to a coffee shop called \"The Whole\". While there he noticed the colored pencil drawings of Yoakum and was immediately taken by them. Brand had an account with the Ed Sherbyn Gallery on the north side of Chicago, and he persuaded Sherbyn to exhibit Yoakum's works and even printed his own poster for this show. Norman Mark of The Chicago Daily News wrote an article about Yoakum called \"My drawings are a spiritual unfoldment\"; this article was printed on the back of the poster. Brand informed his artist friends (including Whitney Halstead) about Yoakum and encouraged them to visit \"The Whole\" coffee shop. Halstead, an artist and instructor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, became the greatest promoter of Yoakum's work during his lifetime. He believed that his story was \"more invention than reality... in part myth, Yoakum's life as he would have wished to have lived it.\"[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1967, Yoakum was discovered by the mainstream art community through John Hopgood, an instructor at the twelfth Chicago State College, who saw Yoakum's work hanging in his studio window and purchased twenty-two pictures. A group of students including Roger Brown, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, and Barbara Rossi, and teachers at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, including Ray Yoshida and Whitney Halstead, took an interest in promoting his work. In 1972, just one month before his death, Yoakum was given a one-man show at the Whitney Museum in New York City.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "He started drawing familiar places, such as Green Valley Ashville Kentucky, as a method to capture his memories. However, he shifted towards imaginary landscapes in places he had never visited, like Mt Cloubelle of West India or Mt Mowbullan in Dividing Range near Brisbane Australia. Drawing outlines with ballpoint pen, rarely making corrections, he colored his drawings within the lines using watercolors and pastels. He became known for his organic forms, always using two lines to designate land masses.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the final four months of his life Yoakum's work was marked by a use of pure abstraction, as in his illustration Flooding of Sock River through Ash Grove Mo [Missouri] on July 4, 1914 in that [waters] drove many persons from Homes I were with the Groupe leiving [sic] their homes for safety. That painting was one of his autobiographical works.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the Museum of Modern Art presented more than 100 of his works in an exhibition called Joseph E. Yoakum: What I Saw.[14] It was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Menil Drawing Institute, which is part of the Menil Collection.[7]\n",
      "The Palazzo Colonna (Italian pronunciation: [paˈlattso koˈlonna, - koˈlɔnna]) is a palatial block of buildings in central Rome, Italy, at the base of the Quirinal Hill, and adjacent to the church of Santi Apostoli. It is built in part over the ruins of an old Roman serapeum, and it has belonged to the prominent Colonna family for over twenty generations.\n",
      "The first part of the palace dates from the 13th century, and tradition holds that the building hosted Dante during his visit to Rome. The first documentary mention notes that the property hosted Cardinals Giovanni and Giacomo Colonna in the 13th century. It was also home to Cardinal Oddone Colonna before he ascended to the papacy as Pope Martin V in 1417.\n",
      "\n",
      "With his passing, the palace was sacked during feuds, and the main property passed into the hands of the Della Rovere family. It returned to the Colonna family when Marcantonio I Colonna married Lucrezia Gara Franciotti Della Rovere, the niece of Pope Julius II. The Colonna family's alliance to the Habsburg power likely protected the palace from looting during the Sack of Rome (1527).\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with Filippo Colonna (1578–1639) 01/12/1578 to 25/03/39, many changes have refurbished and create a unitary complex around a central garden. Architects including Girolamo Rainaldi and Paolo Marucelli labored on specific projects. Only in the 17th and 18th centuries were the main facades completed, one facing Piazza SS. Apostoli and the other facing Via della Pilotta. Much of this design was completed by Antonio del Grande (including the grand gallery) and Girolamo Fontana (decoration of the gallery). In the 18th century, the long low facade designed by Nicola Michetti, with later additions by Paolo Posi with taller corner blocks (facing Piazza SS. Apostoli), was constructed and recalls earlier structures resembling a fortification.The main gallery (completed 1703) and the masterful Colonna art collection was acquired after 1650 by both the cardinal Girolamo I Colonna and his nephew, the Connestabile Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna. It includes works by Lorenzo Monaco, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Palma the Elder, Salviati, Bronzino, Tintoretto, Pietro da Cortona, Annibale Carracci (painting of The Beaneater), Guercino, Francesco Albani, Muziano and Guido Reni. Ceiling frescoes by Filippo Gherardi, Giovanni Coli, Sebastiano Ricci, and Giuseppe Bartolomeo Chiari celebrate the role of Marcantonio II Colonna in the battle of Lepanto (1571). An Apotheosis of Martin V was painted by Benedetto Luti. There are frescoed apartments completed after 1664 by Crescenzio Onofri, Gaspard Dughet and Pieter Mulier II (nicknamed \"Cavalier Tempesta\"). Other rooms were frescoed in the 18th century by Pompeo Batoni and Pietro Bianchi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The older wing of the complex, now known as Princess Isabelle's apartments, but once housing Martin V's library and palace, contains frescoes by Pinturicchio, Antonio Tempesta, Crescenzio Onofri, Giacinto Gimignani, and Carlo Cesi. It also contains a collection of landscapes and genre scenes by painters like Gaspard Dughet, Caspar Van Wittel (Vanvitelli), and Jan Brueghel the Elder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the possessions of the Doria-Pamphilij the 456th and Pallavicini-Rospigliosi families, this is one of the largest private art collections in Rome.$500, ₹200, £600\n",

      "The ending scene from the 1953 classic film Roman Holiday, starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, was shot at the gallery.\n",
      "Eucalyptus campanulata, commonly known as the New England blackbutt, gum-topped peppermint[3] or New England ash,[4th] is a tree that is endemic to eastern Australia. It has rough, finely fibrous greyish bark on the trunk and larger branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of between eleven and fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit.\n",
      "Eucalyptus campanulata is a tree that grows to a height of 25 m (80 ft), sometimes 45 m (148 ft) and has rough, finely fibrous, greyish brown bark on the trunk and main branches, smooth whitish bark on the thinner branches. The leaves on young plants are lance-shaped to egg-shaped or curved, 70–130 mm (3–5 in) long, 30–50 mm (1–2 in) wide and bluish or greyish green. The adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, 90–175 mm (3.5–6.9 in) long and 15–40 mm (0.6–2 in) wide on a petiole 11–23 mm (0.43–0.91 in) long. The leaves are the same bluish green on both surfaces. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between eleven and fifteen on a peduncle 10–20 mm (0.4–0.8 in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 4–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long. Mature buds are club-shaped, 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide with an operculum as wide as, but shorter than the floral cup. Flowering occurs from October to December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a bell-shaped or conical capsule, 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) long and 4–7 mm (0.16–0.28 in) wide on a pedicel 3–6 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long.[3][4][5]\n",
      "103rd\n",
      "This species is distinguished from E. andrewsii by the shape of the fifth fruit, being bell-shaped rather than cup-shaped.[6th]Eucalyptus campanulata was first formally described in 1912 by Richard Baker and Henry Smith who published the description in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales.[7] The specific epithet (campanulata) is a Latin word meaning \"bell-shaped\", referring to the fruit.[3][8]\n",
      "New England blackbutt is widespread and common on fertile soils in wetter areas between south-east Queensland and the southern end of Barrington Tops in New South Wales, especially on the eastern side of the Northern Tablelands.[3][5]\n",
      "A throttle body spacer is usually a 1-inch (25 mm)  01/01/2000 thick piece of metal that is bolted to the outlet of the throttle body of an automotive engine upstream of air flow into the manifold. By changing the airflow, this after-market add-on claims to be a performance enhancing accessory that can increase an engine's horse power, torque and fuel economy. It functions by swirling or directing the air flow to maximize air volume to the manifold. There is much debate about the veracity of the manufacturers' claims for these devices. The general consensus is that it works well on some engine configurations, and not at all or adversely on others. In 2009 the BBK Performance R&D Department performed extensive dyno testing of off the shelf throttle body spacers from other manufacturers. The intention was to determine whether or not throttle body spacers were a viable product that BBK could manufacture that would provide notable results for their customers. The tests were performed on Ford 4.6L 3-V, GM LS, and Mopar HEMI V8 applications using a Dynojet 248th C dynamometer. The tests consisted of a baseline dyno run, cool down period, and a repeat test after the spacers were installed. None of the spacers produced any additional horsepower or torque when tested. The only notable change was a loss of 4 horsepower to the tires on the Mopar application with the spacer installed. An additional test was run after removing the spacer, resulting in a return of the lost horsepower. Proving that some spacers can actually rob power from an engine. After seeing the results, it was clear that throttle body spacers were simply gimmicks and provided no real performance value. BBK scrapped all plans to manufacture throttle body spacers.Engine Costs: $100, ₹7550.63, £90.85\n"

      "Brand informed his artist friends (including Whitney Halstead) about Yoakum and encouraged them to visit \"The Whole\" coffee shop.\n",
      "Halstead, an artist and instructor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, became the greatest promoter of Yoakum's work during his lifetime.\n",
      "He believed that his story was \"more invention than reality... in part myth, Yoakum's life as he would have wished to have lived it.\n",
      "\"[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1967, Yoakum was discovered by the mainstream art community through John Hopgood, an instructor at the twelfth Chicago State College, who saw Yoakum's work hanging in his studio window and purchased twenty-two pictures.\n",
      "A group of students including Roger Brown, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, and Barbara Rossi, and teachers at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, including Ray Yoshida and Whitney Halstead, took an interest in promoting his work.\n",
      "In 1972, just one month before his death, Yoakum was given a one-man show at the Whitney Museum in New York City.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "He started drawing familiar places, such as Green Valley Ashville Kentucky, as a method to capture his memories.\n",
      "However, he shifted towards imaginary landscapes in places he had never visited, like Mt Cloubelle of West India or Mt Mowbullan in Dividing Range near Brisbane Australia.\n",
      "Drawing outlines with ballpoint pen, rarely making corrections, he colored his drawings within the lines using watercolors and pastels.\n",
      "He became known for his organic forms, always using two lines to designate land masses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During the final four months of his life Yoakum's work was marked by a use of pure abstraction, as in his illustration Flooding of Sock River through Ash Grove Mo [Missouri] on July 4, 1914 in that [waters] drove many persons from Homes I were with the Groupe leiving\n",
      "[sic] their homes for safety.\n",

      "Palazzo Colonna (Italian pronunciation:\n",
      "[paˈlattso koˈlonna, - koˈlɔnna]) is a palatial block of buildings in central Rome, Italy, at the base of the Quirinal Hill, and adjacent to the church of Santi Apostoli.\n",
      "It is built in part over the ruins of an old Roman serapeum, and it has belonged to the prominent Colonna family for over twenty generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of the palace dates from the 13th century, and tradition holds that the building hosted Dante during his visit to Rome.\n",
      "The first documentary mention notes that the property hosted Cardinals Giovanni and Giacomo Colonna in the 13th century.\n",
      "It was also home to Cardinal Oddone Colonna before he ascended to the papacy as Pope Martin V in 1417.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With his passing, the palace was sacked during feuds, and the main property passed into the hands of the Della Rovere family.\n",
      "It returned to the Colonna family when Marcantonio I Colonna married Lucrezia Gara Franciotti Della Rovere, the niece of Pope Julius II.\n",
      "The Colonna family's alliance to the Habsburg power likely protected the palace from looting during the Sack of Rome (1527).\n",

      "Starting with Filippo Colonna (1578–1639) 01/12/1578 to 25/03/39, many changes have refurbished and create a unitary complex around a central garden.\n",
      "Architects including Girolamo Rainaldi and Paolo Marucelli labored on specific projects.\n",
      "Only in the 17th and 18th centuries were the main facades completed, one facing Piazza SS.\n",
      "Apostoli and the other facing Via della Pilotta.\n",
      "Much of this design was completed by Antonio del Grande (including the grand gallery) and Girolamo Fontana (decoration of the gallery).\n",
      "In the 18th century, the long low facade designed by Nicola Michetti, with later additions by Paolo Posi with taller corner blocks (facing Piazza SS.\n",
      "Apostoli), was constructed and recalls earlier structures resembling a fortification.\n",
      "The main gallery (completed 1703) and the masterful Colonna art collection was acquired after 1650 by both the cardinal Girolamo I Colonna and his nephew, the Connestabile Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna.\n",
      "It includes works by Lorenzo Monaco, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Palma the Elder, Salviati, Bronzino, Tintoretto, Pietro da Cortona, Annibale Carracci (painting of The Beaneater), Guercino, Francesco Albani, Muziano and Guido Reni.\n",
      "Ceiling frescoes by Filippo Gherardi, Giovanni Coli, Sebastiano Ricci, and Giuseppe Bartolomeo Chiari celebrate the role of Marcantonio II Colonna in the battle of Lepanto (1571).\n",
      "An Apotheosis of Martin V was painted by Benedetto Luti.\n",
      "There are frescoed apartments completed after 1664 by Crescenzio Onofri, Gaspard Dughet and Pieter Mulier II (nicknamed \"Cavalier Tempesta\").\n",
      "Other rooms were frescoed in the 18th century by Pompeo Batoni and Pietro Bianchi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The older wing of the complex, now known as Princess Isabelle's apartments, but once housing Martin V's library and palace, contains frescoes by Pinturicchio, Antonio Tempesta, Crescenzio Onofri, Giacinto Gimignani, and Carlo Cesi.\n",
      "It also contains a collection of landscapes and genre scenes by painters like Gaspard Dughet, Caspar Van Wittel (Vanvitelli), and Jan Brueghel the Elder.\n",

      "Along with the possessions of the Doria-Pamphilij the 456th and Pallavicini-Rospigliosi families, this is one of the largest private art collections in Rome.$500, ₹200, £600\n",

      "Eucalyptus campanulata is a tree that grows to a height of 25 m (80 ft), sometimes 45 m (148 ft) and has rough, finely fibrous, greyish brown bark on the trunk and main branches, smooth whitish bark on the thinner branches.\n",
      "The leaves on young plants are lance-shaped to egg-shaped or curved, 70–130 mm (3–5 in) long, 30–50 mm (1–2 in) wide and bluish or greyish green.\n",
      "The adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, 90–175 mm (3.5–6.9 in) long and 15–40 mm (0.6–2 in) wide on a petiole 11–23 mm (0.43–0.91 in) long.\n",
      "The leaves are the same bluish green on both surfaces.\n",
      "The flower buds are arranged in groups of between eleven and fifteen on a peduncle 10–20 mm (0.4–0.8 in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 4–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long.\n",
      "Mature buds are club-shaped, 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long and 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide with an operculum as wide as, but shorter than the floral cup.\n",
      "Flowering occurs from October to December and the flowers are white.\n",
      "The fruit is a bell-shaped or conical capsule, 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) long and 4–7 mm (0.16–0.28 in) wide on a pedicel 3–6 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long.[3][4][5]\n",
      "103rd\n",
      "This species is distinguished from E. andrewsii by the shape of the fifth fruit, being bell-shaped rather than cup-shaped.[6th]Eucalyptus campanulata was first formally described in 1912 by Richard Baker and Henry Smith who published the description in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales.[7]\n",
      "The specific epithet (campanulata) is a Latin word meaning \"bell-shaped\", referring to the fruit.[3][8]\n",
      "New England blackbutt is widespread and common on fertile soils in wetter areas between south-east Queensland and the southern end of Barrington Tops in New South Wales, especially on the eastern side of the Northern Tablelands.[3][5]A throttle body spacer is usually a 1-inch (25 mm)  01/01/2000 thick piece of metal that is bolted to the outlet of the throttle body of an automotive engine upstream of air flow into the manifold.\n",
      "By changing the airflow, this after-market add-on claims to be a performance enhancing accessory that can increase an engine's horse power, torque and fuel economy.\n",
      "It functions by swirling or directing the air flow to maximize air volume to the manifold.\n",
      "There is much debate about the veracity of the manufacturers' claims for these devices.\n",
      "The general consensus is that it works well on some engine configurations, and not at all or adversely on others.\n",
      "In 2009 the BBK Performance R&D Department performed extensive dyno testing of off the shelf throttle body spacers from other manufacturers.\n",
      "The intention was to determine whether or not throttle body spacers were a viable product that BBK could manufacture that would provide notable results for their customers.\n",
      "The tests were performed on Ford 4.6L 3-V, GM LS, and Mopar HEMI V8 applications using a Dynojet 248th C dynamometer.\n",
      "The tests consisted of a baseline dyno run, cool down period, and a repeat test after the spacers were installed.\n",
      "None of the spacers produced any additional horsepower or torque when tested.\n",
      "The only notable change was a loss of 4 horsepower to the tires on the Mopar application with the spacer installed.\n",
      "An additional test was run after removing the spacer, resulting in a return of the lost horsepower.\n",
      "Proving that some spacers can actually rob power from an engine.\n",
      "After seeing the results, it was clear that throttle body spacers were simply gimmicks and provided no real performance value.\n",
      "BBK scrapped all plans to manufacture throttle body spacers.\n",
